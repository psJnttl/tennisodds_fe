I needed a tool to evaluate how accurate gamblers are when assessing odds for tennis players. It doesn't
tell much about the player's chances of winning the next game. However, it can give an idea how reliable
given odds for players are. It's just one data point, so when gambling other homework has to be done too.
This project gave me an opportunity to do pagination with Bootstrap and try out the excellent autocomplete
component react-select (https://jedwatson.github.io/react-select/).

The base of this app is done with create-react-app. Clone to local directory, run npm install and
start the app with npm start. App available to browser at localhost:3000
